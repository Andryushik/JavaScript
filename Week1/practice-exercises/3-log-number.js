// 1. Declare your variable numberX. Do not initialize it (which means, don't give it a starting value) yet
let numberX;

// 2. Add a console.log statement that explains in words what you think the value of x is
console.log('X number is not defined');

// 3. Add a console.log statement that logs the value of numberX.
console.log(numberX);

// 4. Now initialize your variable numberX with a number (also called an integer in computer science terms)
numberX = 5;

// 5. Next, add a console.log statement that explains what you think the value of numberX is
console.log('X number is now 5');

// 6. Add a console.log statement that logs the value of numberX

console.log(numberX);
